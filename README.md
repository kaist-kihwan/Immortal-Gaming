# Immortal-Gaming

'Immortal Gaming' is a decentralized system that allows a game to operate without a developer or publisher. By using blockchain technology to replace servers and AI agents to take on the role of developers, the game can be sustained indefinitely. This system can be applied to online games that use an in-app payment business model. Unlike P2E (Play-to-Earn) games, this system does not provide a way for players to monetize.
